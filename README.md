# ArchitectNow.ReactStarter

This general structure/setup was initial extracted from the [TypeScript-React-Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter).

That project utilizes [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) for it's core setup.

The ReadMe for the initial setup has been left in the [src] folder.
